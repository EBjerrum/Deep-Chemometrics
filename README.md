# Deep Chemometrics with Data Augmentation

![Deep Chemometrics Rising](https://www.wildcardconsulting.dk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Li_Banner.png)

The repository contains two examples of using convolutional neural networks to model spectroscopical data with data augmentation or EMSC as means to handle the variation in baseline.

The first example show what kind of results are possible using data augmentation: ![Example with DA](https://github.com/EBjerrum/Deep-Chemometrics/blob/master/Deep_Chemometrics_with_data_augmentation.py.ipynb)

The other example use the same setup, but with EMSC used for baseline correction: ![Example with EMSC](https://github.com/EBjerrum/Deep-Chemometrics/blob/master/Deep_Chemometrics_EMSC_only.py.ipynb)

The approach and background + a comparison with PLS models are further described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.01927
and the blog post https://www.wildcardconsulting.dk/useful-information/deep-chemometrics-deep-learning-for-spectroscopy/
